# AutoLinear Plugin

**Version**: 0.3.0
**Category**: Automation
**Marketplace**: [magus-alpha](https://github.com/MadAppGang/magus-alpha)
**Status**: Alpha — manual path works end-to-end; autonomous webhook pickup is partial (see [Current State](#current-state))

Autonomous task execution with Linear integration. Picks tasks from Linear, routes to appropriate agents via tag-to-command mapping, generates proof-of-work artifacts, and handles feedback loops.

> **Renamed from `autopilot`.** Previously shipped as `autopilot@magus`. Now `autolinear@magus-alpha`. If you had the old plugin installed, remove it (`/plugin remove autopilot@magus`) and re-install from the alpha marketplace.

## Current State

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Linear API CRUD, state transitions, comments | ✅ wired |
| Manual orchestrator `/autolinear:run <id>` | ✅ wired |
| `task-executor` / `proof-generator` / `feedback-processor` agent prompts | ✅ wired |
| Webhook receiver (HMAC verify, queue push) | ✅ wired |
| Webhook queue → Claude Code dispatch | 🚧 stub (TODO in `scripts/webhook-server.ts`) |
| Linear file attachment (screenshots → issue) | 🚧 stub (TODO in `scripts/linear-client.ts`) |
| `validate-linear-state.sh` PreToolUse hook | 🚧 stub |
| Persistent task queue across restarts | ❌ not started (in-memory only) |

## Features

- **Linear Integration**: Create, query, and manage Linear issues directly from Claude Code
- **Tag-Based Routing**: Automatically route tasks to appropriate commands based on Linear labels
- **Proof-of-Work**: Generate validation artifacts (screenshots, test results, coverage)
- **Feedback Loops**: Process Linear comments and iterate on implementations
- **State Machine**: Manage task lifecycle with validation gates

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install npm dependencies
bun add @linear/sdk playwright

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Configure Linear Connection

```bash
# Set environment variables
export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
export LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"  # Optional for webhooks
export AUTOLINEAR_BOT_USER_ID="user_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"   # Your Linear user ID

# Run configuration wizard
/autolinear:config
```

### 3. Create Your First Task

```bash
# Create a task from CLI
/autolinear:create-task Add user profile page with avatar upload
```

### 4. Check Status

```bash
# View queue and active tasks
/autolinear:status

# View specific task
/autolinear:status ISS-123
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/autolinear:create-task` | Create Linear task and assign to autolinear |
| `/autolinear:status [id]` | Check status, queue, and progress |
| `/autolinear:config` | Configure Linear integration |
| `/autolinear:run <id>` | Manually trigger task execution |
| `/autolinear:help` | Show help |

## Tag-to-Command Mapping

When autolinear picks up a task, it routes to the appropriate command based on Linear labels:

| Tag | Command | Use Case |
|-----|---------|----------|
| @frontend | /dev:feature | React/Vue/TypeScript implementation |
| @backend | /dev:implement | API/database work |
| @debug | /dev:debug | Bug investigation and fixing |
| @test | /dev:test-architect | Test creation |
| @review | /commit-commands:commit-push-pr | Code review + PR |
| @refactor | /dev:implement | Code improvement |
| @research | /dev:deep-research | Investigation tasks |
| @ui | /dev:ui | Design validation |

### Precedence Rules

When multiple tags are present:
1. @debug (highest)
2. @test
3. @ui
4. @frontend
5. @backend
6. @review
7. @refactor
8. @research (lowest)

## Workflow

```
Linear Issue (with @autolinear label)
        │
        ▼
   Tag Detection ──► Command Selection
        │
        ▼
   Task Execution (via task-executor agent)
        │
        ▼
   Proof Generation (screenshots, tests, deployment)
        │
        ▼
   Validation (confidence scoring)
        │
        ▼
   State Transition (Todo → In Progress → In Review → Done)
        │
        ▼
   Feedback Loop (if changes requested)
```

## Proof-of-Work

Every completed task includes proof artifacts:

### Bug Fix
- Git diff summary
- All tests passing
- Regression test

### Feature
- Screenshots (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- Test results
- Coverage report (>= 80%)
- Build output

### UI Change
- Multi-viewport screenshots
- Accessibility score
- Visual regression (optional)

### Confidence Scoring

| Component | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Tests Pass | 40 |
| Build Success | 20 |
| Coverage >= 80% | 20 |
| 3 Screenshots | 10 |
| Lint Clean | 10 |

**Thresholds:**
- >= 95%: Auto-approve
- 80-94%: Manual review
- < 80%: Iterate

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx       # Linear API key
LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx  # Webhook signature secret
AUTOLINEAR_BOT_USER_ID=user_xxxxxxxxxxxxx   # Bot user ID

# Optional
AUTOLINEAR_WEBHOOK_PORT=3001                # Webhook server port
AUTOLINEAR_MAX_FEEDBACK_ROUNDS=5            # Max iterations
AUTOLINEAR_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=95          # Auto-approval threshold
```

### Settings File (.claude/autolinear.local.md)

```yaml

  project_id: "PROJECT_xxxxx"

proof:
  confidence_threshold: 95
  max_feedback_rounds: 5
  require_screenshots: true
  require_coverage: 80

| proof-of-work | Artifact generation |
| state-machine | Lifecycle management |

## Webhook Server (Optional)

For automatic task pickup, run the webhook server:

```bash
# Start webhook server
bun run plugins/autolinear/scripts/webhook-server.ts

# Server endpoints:
# - POST /webhook  - Linear webhook receiver
# - GET /health    - Health check
# - GET /queue     - View task queue
```

Configure Linear webhook to point to your server URL.
